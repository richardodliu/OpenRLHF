\subsection{Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning}
\label{sec:rl}
Reinforcement learning (RL) is the critical next step for translating knowledge from pre-training and SFT into advanced thinking. To enable RL at the unprecedented scale of \textbf{1 Trillion} parameters, we developed a novel RL algorithm and a specialized infrastructure, Asystem. This integrated solution overcomes fundamental challenges in training efficiency and stability, allowing us to systematically explore the model's complex problem-solving capabilities.

\section{Approach}
\label{sec:method}
The \model{} model was developed via a multi-stage pipeline, commencing with long-CoT SFT and advancing through reasoning and general RL phases. 
While the complete pipeline is integral to the model's performance, the primary focus of this report is on RL components. We first summarize the long-CoT SFT process that primes the model for RL in Section~\ref{sec:sft}. 
The core of our discussion then turns to the novel RL algorithm, which is elaborated upon in Section~\ref{sec:rl}.
Additionally, we introduce ASystem in Section~\ref{subsec:asys}, the distributed system that enabled the large-scale RL training necessary for this project.
